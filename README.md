# Species-Classification-with-Palmer-Penguins-Dataset

The following project uses data cleaning techniques, exploratory data analysis, and k-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forests classification models in order to accurately distinguish between penguin species from the islands of Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The limitations are that exactly 1 qualitative feature and 2 quantitative features must be utilized in the modeling.

The dataset used is sourced from the Palmer Station Long-Term Ecological Research (PAL-LTER) data system, a research program located in Antarctica and funded by the National Science Foundation. The file includes physical characteristics of various penguin species native to the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica.
