# Species-Classification-with-Palmer-Penguins-Dataset

The following project uses data cleaning techniques, exploratory data analysis, and k-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forests classification models in order to accurately distinguish between penguin species from the islands of Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. The limitations are that exactly 1 qualitative feature and 2 quantitative features must be utilized in the modeling.

The file used is a collection of data sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes physical characteristics of various penguin species native to the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica.
